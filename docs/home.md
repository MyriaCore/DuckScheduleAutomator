## Intro / Lay of the Land
This is probably gonna be the worst documentation you've read in your entire life, so bear with me here.

At the top of every page, there'll be a list of pages (should be updated) and a list of sections in the current page 
(definitely should be updated). If at any time you want to read any other pages, you can use that.

This whole folder will just be me writing things down that I want to remember, and that are generally important to the project.
Right now, there are 4 pages: this one, [one about the website sitscheduler.com](sitsched.md), 
[one about web.stevens.edu/scheduler](stevens-scheduler.md), and finally [one about the official stevens signup portal](signup.md).
Documentation about sitscheduler was included because it was thought to be the best / easiest source of class information, but 
recent findings have revealed that web.stevens.edu/scheduler is a more reliable and official source of class information.
<!-- TODO: Document actual code and what it give back -->
